## Who Am I?
I am currently pursuing my Bachelors of Engineering under the domain of Computer Science Engineering. I am passionate about my work. Because I love what I do, I have a steady source of motivation that drives me forward. I am also an upbeat, ambitious, self-motivated team player and driven person with proven leadership capabilities, who likes to take initiative and seek out new challenges. I thrive on challenges and constantly set goals for myself. So I have something to strive forward and achieve in my life. I am always looking for an opportunity to do better and achieve greatness.

Being a Sophomore , I am still learning and therefore need an opportunity to know more about Open Source.Though I am new, I can vouch for the fact that I am a fast learner with a penchant to both learn and unlearn,(i.e) learning the latest relevant skills, business best practices and corporate etiquette, while letting go of obsolete beliefs, skills and procedures. I also bring with me some fresh ideas and hope to discuss the same with all people out here. I am confident they will find many of them to be quite useful and innovative. I will strive to add maximum value to the people around me - in terms of my eagerness to learn, dedication and strong work ethic - to ensure a mutually beneficial professional partnership
